When designing a Linux command using object-oriented programming principles, consider the following problem using a file management command as an example:
Problem: Designing a command-line tool to manage files, allowing users to list, create, delete, and move files.
Solution:
Identify Classes and Objects:
File: Represents a file with attributes like name, path, size, and type.
Directory: Represents a directory, containing methods to list files, create/delete files, and move files.
Command: An abstract class or interface for all commands (list, create, delete, move).
ListCommand, CreateCommand, DeleteCommand, MoveCommand: Concrete implementations of the Command interface, each handling a specific action.
Define Relationships:
Directory can contain multiple File objects.
Each concrete Command object interacts with File and Directory objects.
Implement Functionality:
File class:
Python

        class File:
            def __init__(self, name, path, size=0, file_type="file"):
                self.name = name
                self.path = path
                self.size = size
                self.file_type = file_type
Directory class.
Python

        import os
        
        class Directory:
            def __init__(self, path):
                self.path = path
        
            def list_files(self):
                return os.listdir(self.path)
        
            def create_file(self, file_name):
                with open(os.path.join(self.path, file_name), 'w'):
                    pass
        
            def delete_file(self, file_name):
                os.remove(os.path.join(self.path, file_name))
        
            def move_file(self, old_name, new_path):
                 os.rename(os.path.join(self.path, old_name), os.path.join(new_path, old_name))
Command interface and concrete commands.
Python

        from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
        
        class Command(ABC):
            @abstractmethod
            def execute(self):
                pass
        
        class ListCommand(Command):
            def __init__(self, directory):
                self.directory = directory
        
            def execute(self):
                return self.directory.list_files()
        
        class CreateCommand(Command):
            def __init__(self, directory, file_name):
                self.directory = directory
                self.file_name = file_name
        
            def execute(self):
                self.directory.create_file(self.file_name)
        
        class DeleteCommand(Command):
            def __init__(self, directory, file_name):
                self.directory = directory
                self.file_name = file_name
        
            def execute(self):
                self.directory.delete_file(self.file_name)
        
        class MoveCommand(Command):
            def __init__(self, directory, old_name, new_path):
              self.directory = directory
              self.old_name = old_name
              self.new_path = new_path
        
            def execute(self):
                self.directory.move_file(self.old_name, self.new_path)
Handle User Input:
Parse command-line arguments to determine the action and parameters.
Create the appropriate Command object based on the input.
Execute the command.
Python

    import sys
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        command_args = sys.argv[1:]
        if not command_args:
            print("Usage: file_manager <command> [options]")
            sys.exit(1)
    
    
        command_name = command_args[0]
        current_directory = Directory(os.getcwd())
    
        if command_name == "list":
            list_command = ListCommand(current_directory)
            print(list_command.execute())
        elif command_name == "create":
            if len(command_args) < 2:
                print("Usage: file_manager create <file_name>")
                sys.exit(1)
            file_name = command_args[1]
            create_command = CreateCommand(current_directory, file_name)
            create_command.execute()
        elif command_name == "delete":
          if len(command_args) < 2:
                print("Usage: file_manager delete <file_name>")
                sys.exit(1)
          file_name = command_args[1]
          delete_command = DeleteCommand(current_directory, file_name)
          delete_command.execute()
        elif command_name == "move":
          if len(command_args) < 3:
                print("Usage: file_manager move <old_name> <new_path>")
                sys.exit(1)
          old_name = command_args[1]
          new_path = command_args[2]
          move_command = MoveCommand(current_directory, old_name, new_path)
          move_command.execute()
        else:
            print("Invalid command.")
            sys.exit(1)
This structure allows for easy extension with new commands and functionalities while maintaining a clean, organized codebase.
