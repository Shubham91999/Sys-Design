This class encapsulates the essential information for each coffee item: name, price and recipe - which includes the list of ingredients and their required quantity.\n",

Accessor method provided to update the quantity of particular ingredient. To make this class thread safe, threading.lock() can be added in constructor.\n",

    "#### 3. **Class Payment**: represents the amount a user pays during a coffee order. This class can be extended to handle payment validation, change calculation, or even handle different methods like coins or cards.\n",

    "#### 4. **Class CoffeeMachine**: Implemented as a singleton to ensure there's only one active instance representing the physical machine. This prevents the shared state issues and mirrors the real-world constraint of a single hardware instance.\n",
