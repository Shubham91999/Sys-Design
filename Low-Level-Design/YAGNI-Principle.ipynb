It needs to be developed, tested, maintained, and understood by other developers. <br><br> By adding unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions, we incur additional complexity, which can slow down development, increase the likelihood of bugs, and make the codebase harder to maintain. <br><br><hr>\n",
